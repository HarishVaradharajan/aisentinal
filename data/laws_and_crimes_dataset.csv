IPC Section 8,Avoids archaic interpretations,"Interpretation, Legal Evolution, Modern Context",This section helps to avoid archaic interpretations of the IPC based on outdated understandings of gender and the use of language.,The law must be interpreted in a way that reflects contemporary social norms and values.,"Smt. Om Wati vs. State (1991 CriLJ 2439 Delhi): In this case, the Delhi High Court held that the use of the pronoun ""he"" in Section 498A of the IPC (cruelty by husband or relatives) does not exclude the possibility of a female relative being held liable. This interpretation aligns with the spirit of Section 8.","This section establishes a fundamental principle of gender neutrality in the interpretation of the Indian Penal Code. By explicitly stating that masculine pronouns encompass all persons, regardless of their gender, it ensures that the law is applied inclusively and without discrimination. This provision is crucial for preventing interpretations that might limit the scope of offences or liabilities based solely on the use of male pronouns. It reflects a commitment to equality before the law and ensures that the IPC remains relevant and applicable to all members of society."
